# Week 5

## Working on

- Continue getting familiar with a simple development environment 
- Making use of git for version control
- Writing simple algorithms to manipulate arrays

## Have already completed ...

*  worksheet4 and handed in worksheet 3
* pushed your previously completed code project to you worksheet4_tasks repo

If you have not already completed this please do so **ASAP**.

## By the end of the week...

... you should have completed:

* Attend online lecture
* Attend a face-to-face tutorial (or online if limited by restrictions)
* Attend a face-to-face practical (or online if limited by restrictions)
* Worksheet 5

...you should be able to:

- Write functions including selecting appropriate return types and arguments
- Make function calls and pass arguments to functions when calling them
- Use existing functions from a library to program more complex tasks
- Use nested loops and conditional statements
- Traverse arrays using loops
- Implement simple string manipulation alogorithms
